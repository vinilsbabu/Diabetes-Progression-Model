# Diabetes Progression Model

## Objective
This project aims to model the progression of diabetes using machine learning techniques, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model utilizes the Diabetes dataset from the `sklearn` library to understand how various factors influence diabetes progression, providing insights that can aid healthcare professionals in designing better treatment plans and preventive measures.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset from the `sklearn` library. It contains features that describe various health measurements of individuals along with the target variable indicating the progression of diabetes.

## Key Components

1. **Loading and Preprocessing**
    - Load the Diabetes dataset.
    - Handle missing values (if any).
    - Normalize features for better performance of the ANN model.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Analyze the distribution of features and the target variable.
    - Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.

3. **Building the ANN Model**
    - Design a simple ANN architecture with at least one hidden layer.
    - Use appropriate activation functions.

4. **Training the ANN Model**
    - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    - Train the model using the training data with a suitable loss function and optimizer.

5. **Evaluating the Model**
    - Evaluate the model on the testing data.
    - Report performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score.

6. **Improving the Model**
    - Experiment with different architectures, activation functions, or hyperparameters to enhance model performance.
    - Report changes made and corresponding improvements in performance.
